## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
This is the 2nd-time submission. In this submission, the main modifications are as follows:

1. Images are displayed in much neater way. As suggested by the reviewer, the display of exemplary images, the bar plot and the final testing results exhibition are all modified.

2. The gray transformation is tried, and histogram equalization and contrast stretch are implemented. Based on experiments, the contrast stretch is a little better.

3. Geometric transformation based training data augmentation is introduced. The training dataset has scaled a lot.

4. Based on the augmented dataset, better testing accuracy is achieved, not only on testing set, but also on wild dataset.

5. More explanations are given about the model training and parameter selection. The CNN structure is also given.
